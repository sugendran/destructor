This game is made using phaserjs.

The zombie sprites are from http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.com/2014/02/top-down-view-zombies.html

The sounds I found on http://opengameart.org/ and are part of the Digital SFX set by Kenney Vleugels

The ground image was also found on http://opengameart.org/

All the other graphics are made by me and if people turn this into a commercial game I will be most upset. So I'm licencing this under creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)
